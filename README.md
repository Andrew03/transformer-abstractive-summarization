Code for the paper "Efficient Adaption of Pretrained Transformers for Abstractive Summarization"

## Requirements

To run the training script in [train.py](train.py) you will need in addition:
- PyTorch (version >=0.4)
- tqdm
- pyrouge
- [newsroom](https://github.com/clic-lab/newsroom)
- tensorflow (cpu version is ok)
- nltk
- spacy (and 'en' model)

You can download the weights of the OpenAI pre-trained version by cloning [Alec Radford's repo](https://github.com/openai/finetune-transformer-lm) and placing the `model` folder containing the pre-trained weights in the present repo.


In order to run this code, you will need to pre-process the datasets using bpe through the scripts provided in [scripts](scripts)
## Dataset Preprocessing
The training and evaluation scripts expect 3 total output files: `train_encoded.jsonl`, `val_encoded.jsonl`, and `test_encoded.jsonl`

### CNN/Daily Mail
The data and splits used in the paper can be downloaded from [OpenNMT](http://opennmt.net/OpenNMT-py/Summarization.html). 
First, remove the start and end sentence tags using the sed command in the link provided.
To process the data, run the following command:
```
python scripts/encode_cnndm.py --src_file {source file} --tgt_file {target file} --out_file {output file}
```

### XSum
The data and splits used in the paper can be scraped using [XSum](https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/XSum/tree/master/XSum-Dataset). 
Run the commands up through `Extract text from HTML Files` section.
To process the data, run the following command:
```
python scripts/encode_xsum.py --summary_dir {summary directory} --splits_file {split file} --train_file {train file} --val_file {val file} --test_file {test_file}
```

### Newsroom
The data and splits used in the paper can be downloaded from [Newsroom](https://summari.es/download/). 
To process the data, run the following command:
```
python scripts/encode_newsroom.py --in_file {input split file} --out_file {output file}
```

## Training
To train a model, run the following command:
```
python train.py \
  --data_dir {directory containing encoded data} \
  --output_dir {name of folder to save data in} \
  --experiment_name {name of experiment to save data with} \
  --show_progress \
  --doc_model \
  --num_epochs_dat 10 \
  --num_epochs_ft 10 \
  --use_pretrain
```
to train the pre-trained document embedding model over `dataset` for 10 epochs using domain adaptive training, and 10 epochs using fine tuning. Training is currently optimized for multi-gpu usage, and may not work for single gpu machines.

## Evaluation
To evaluate a model, run the following command:
```
python evaluate.py \
  --data_file {path to encoded data file encoded data} \
  --checkpoint {checkpoint to load model weights from} \
  --beam {beam size to do beam search with} \
  --doc_model \
  --use_test \
```
to evaluate the document embedding model on the test set. Evaluation is currently optimized for multi-gpu usage, and may not work for single gpu machines. 
Since the evaluation script will leave out some examples if the number of data points isn't divisible by the number of gpus, you might need to run the 
`create_small_test.py` script to get the last few files that are being left out and aggregate results at the end.
